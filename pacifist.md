#Undertale - True Pacifist Route
-----
#####This guide assumes the player has beaten the game before and has a basic understanding of the story progression and battle mechanics.
-----
--

### Records
- Record your playthrough in an unedited video format or stream it and submit the VOD(s) to [speedrun.com](http://www.speedrun.com/undertale#True_Pacifist_Ending1).
- As of writing, WR time is 1:52:07 by TGH.


### Route Rules
- Start with a 0-reset fresh game. You can do this by deleting the UNDERTALE folder located in `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local`.
- Complete the True Pacifist route, which requires achieving a Neutral ending at least once during the run.
- Most controllers are allowed as long as they do not have a turbo function or any other software macro.
- Time begins on "YES" during name select and ends on the last text box you go through with Toriel.
- Times are recorded as Real Time Attack (RTA).

### Tricks and Info
- Game Maker executables run in "Room Speed" which is Game Maker's limit to the number of "Steps" that should happen per second in a given "Room". A "Step" in Game Maker is the interval at which code is executed. Most or all of the rooms in this game seem to be at the default (30 Steps per second). The real time FPS and the Room Speed may desync occasionally, causing slight variations in events.
- "Random" encounters are tracked by the number of steps taken in a "Room". There is a small variance: possibly due to inconsistent frame rate/room speed, possibly intentional, or both.  
- In this route most encounters are set in a predetermined order. You can delay encounters by pressing `C / CTRL` on the same frame as moving, but it has no practical uses yet.
- It is possible to fail to `Flee` from monsters, although it is very rare. The reason is not yet known, however, it's commonly thought to be timing based.
- Holding `UP` + `DOWN` while against an upper wall allows you to rapidly swap between facing up and down. The game was coded in a way that allows bidirectional override: otherwise referred to as "wallhumping". This is a convenient way to increment the step tracker quickly but it will only increment once per "Step", regardless of how many directions are held.
- Moving in a direction and then switching windows will allow you to move in place, incrementing the step tracker at the same rate as the "Room Speed". Press all of the directions at once to cancel the movement afterward.
- Changing rooms resets the step counter. Staying in the same room after an encounter effectively doubles the time until the next encounter. Some rooms, generally large puzzle rooms, have a longer predetermined time for encounters.
- Rapidly press `Z` and `X` with one hand and `Enter` and `Shift` with the other to advance most dialogue faster. This will be referred to as "mashing" throughout the rest of the guide and will be implied for almost all dialogue.
- Holding `X / SHIFT` while in battle allows your SOUL to move slower.
- `SAVE` sparingly. With some practice you should only need to `SAVE` before restarting the game at certain points.
- Name the Fallen Human a one character name. In Waterfall the difference between a one character name and a six character name is .4 seconds.
- The game will need to be closed and reopened multiple times. Pay careful attention of when to close the game to prevent closing it too early. Use windowed mode at certain points to close the game faster.
- Making a shortcut to your `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\UNDERTALE` is highly recommended. Making copies of your game files can be useful for practicing parts of the game.
- If you have the Steam version: locate the executable at `Steam\steamapps\common\Undertale\UNDERTALE.exe` and use an unzipping program to extract the contents into a folder on your desktop. Go to that folder and delete the file named `steam_api.dll`. While in that folder, locate the file named `UNDERTALE.exe` and make a shortcut to it on your desktop. Launch the game from there to remove Steam interference and reduce load times significantly. OR: you can also purchase a DRM-free copy to circumvent Steam completely.
- Consider investing in the proper hardware to further reduce load times.

##### Time begins on selecting `Yes`.

## Ruins

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Froggit | `Compliment+Spare | Flee` | It is faster to hit the frog than wait for it to leap. 2G for sparing tactic.
Whimsun | `Terrorize+Spare | Flee` | 2G for sparing tactic.
Moldsmal | `Imitate/Flirt+Spare | Spare` | 1G for imitating before sparing. Always faster to Spare than Flee.
Napstablook | `Cheer+Cheer+Cheer+Flirt` | *Really not feelin up to it right now. Sorry.*
Loox | `Flee` |
Vegetoid | `Flee` |
Migosp | `Flee` |


Hold RIGHT and move down slightly to avoid hitting the wall, then ride the wall into the next room.

### Your Best Friend
- Walk up to Flowey and mash through all of the text until the battle starts.
- Once the battle begins, keep mashing while also moving to the top right corner.
- It's faster to hit the bullets. Ideally they should hit you before hearing the high note.
- Hold DOWN and LEFT in the bottom left corner to touch the circle of bullets faster.
- Hold UP and mash through Toriel's dialogue until you can move.

Follow Toriel through the next several rooms, mashing and moving as fast as you can. Most of the black door hitboxes are wider than they appear. Wallhump to press the yellow switches and talk to Toriel at the end of the room. Continue into the next room for more of Toriel's dialogue. Move up near Toriel and activate the dummy from as far left as possible.

### Training Dummy
-`Talk` to the training dummy, it's the fastest.

Mash through Toriel's post fight talk and walk up to the next room. Follow Toriel, `Flee` from the Froggit, and continue to the spike bridge. Talk to Toriel before and after the bridge, then enter the next room.

Mash through the dialogue at the start and hold RIGHT until you cross the pillar. Talk to Toriel again and then move right out of the room. Toriel will call several times in the next few rooms, be ready to mash. The answer to the Pie question does not matter.

Take one encounter in each of the first three rooms, starting in the room with the `SAVE`. You will need `7 GOLD` by the time you get to the Spider Bakesale to purchase a `Spider Donut`. Froggits and Whimsuns give 2G each, Moldsmals give 1G each.

Push the first rock from the top instead of the left to avoid walking around it.

Navigate the pitfall room by not walking on the leaves.

In the room with the three rocks, walk into the right side of the bottom rock and talk to it until it moves to the switch. Reset the spikes and move back to the right side of the rock; if lucky, you can force an encounter AND also talk to the rock before the `FIGHT` begins. 

Do the minimum you need to for the remaining Gold you need and move into the next room.

### Here Comes Napstablook.
-`Cheer` three times and then `Flirt` or `Cheer` again.

Go into the right room and buy a `Spider Donut` from the leftmost web. DO NOT EAT IT.

Return to the previous room and go up. Head right to Toriel's call and into the next room.

Pick up the `Faded Ribbon` in the bottom left hole but DO NOT equip it. Fall into the top-middle pitfall and press the switch to enter the next room.

####If You Can Read This...
- Don't press any switches in the first room and walk down.
- Press the `Blue` switch behind the top colomn and walk left.
- Press the `Red` switch next to the left colomn and walk up.
- Press the `Green` switch behind the left colomn and walk right.

Cross the vines and go into the top room.

## Home
- Hold up and mash through everything Toriel has to say. Move around the tree.
- Toriel heals you immediately, so no need to `SAVE`.
- Enter the house, go right and sleep.
- Press `Z` and then down to pick up the `Butterscotch Pie` while moving down after getting out of bed. DON'T EAT IT.
- Talk to Toriel in her chair. Mash through Toriel's text, listen to the bit on snails first (2 dialogue prompts), and select `How to exit the RUINS` on the third prompt.
- Walk down to the basement and follow Toriel to the end, mashing along the way.

###Toriel
- `Spare` every turn and mash through the dialogue.
- Run left into any hand attacks to end them immediately. Ideally you get this attack at least 5 times.
- Stay in the upper left area for every other attack to preserve your health for hand attacks.
- Once you are at `3 HP` run into any attack to end it faster. At `2 HP` Toriel's attacks will avoid you.
- Toriel will avoid attacking you after the 13th turn using `Spare` and then stop attacking completely.
- `Spare` and mash until the end of the fight.

#####Split when you regain control after Toriel leaves the screen. 
- The best time possible for this segment is around 7:40, give or take a few seconds.

Walk up the long hallway, talk to Flowey, and exit the Ruins.

## Path to Snowdin

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Snowdrake | `Flee` |
Ice Cap | `Flee` |
Doggo | `Stick+Spare` |
Lesser Dog | `Flee` | 
Married Dogs | `Stick+Spare` |
Greater Dog | `Stick+Spare` | Run into the barking dog to end the attack faster.

Walk right to where Sans greets you on the bridge. Enter the cutscene on the top edge to save a little time. Mash through the rest of the cutscene, walk down around the lamp and exit to the right.

Use the `SAVE` to heal from Toriel. Don't actually save unless you're learning the route. Avoid triggering an encounter in this room: don't walk around needlessly.

Pick up the `Tough Glove` from the `Box` and equip it to get the `Stick`.
- The `Stick` is effective on all Dog-type enemies, allowing you to `Spare` them the turn after using it.

Continue right into the next room and mash through the dialogue. Expect a Snowdrake near the end of the room and `Flee` from it.

#### Absolutely NO MOVING!!!
- Use the `Stick` and then `Spare`. 
- Move right, wait for Doggo's attack to safely pass, and then follow it left. This ends the attack up to .5 seconds faster.

Keep moving right and slide on the ice in the next room to avoid getting an encounter.

####[Invisible Electricity Maze](http://i.imgur.com/jqyyFZq.png)
- Enter the room holding up and right to move up to the tree before beginning the dialogue.
- Notice the three groups of dense footprints and walk between them: start out on the top side, cross over to the bottom side, then move down to the top side of the last group and walk right to exit the maze. 

Walk diagonally up to the small bridge then diagonally down to the exit. Don't get stuck on the snowdecahedron.

#### Hey Kid's!
- Don't help Ice-E solve the word search. Walk around it and mash through the dialogue.
- Answering `Jumble` is three dialogue boxes faster than answering `Crossword`.

#### Warning: Dog Marriage
- Walk right and up slightly to press the hidden switch from the top left. 
- `Flee` from the Lesser Dog. 
- Avoid getting stuck on the obstacles and stay on the bottom edge when crossing the small bridge.
- Use the `Stick`on the Dogi, dodge the attack, and then `Spare`.

Move down to the small XO puzzle. Turn the Xs into Os and press the grey button. Don't trigger Papyrus' dialogue until the spikes are down. The answer to his question doesn't matter, both have the same amount of dialogue.

#### Flying Papyrus
- Hold right when entering the next room and press the switch on the first tree.
- Walk up as close to the grey button as you can.
- If done correctly, you can press the switch without Papyrus' dialogue triggering. [He just floats across the top](http://www.twitch.tv/th3hatt3r/v/21373800).

>
This is one of the hardest glitches to do reliably so get some practice in.

#### Random Colored Block Puzzle
- Say `No` and `Even less` to the questions to skip the puzzle. Follow Papyrus right.

Walk right past Lesser Dog. Use the `SAVE` to heal to full if you took damage from Dogi or if you didn't heal earlier. Again, don't actually spend time saving unless you are learning the route.

#### Ice Puzzle
- Enter the room holding UP and RIGHT, let go of UP once the first two switches are pressed to slide right.
- The ice sliding puzzle has a [specific strategy](http://i.imgur.com/imntI5i.png) that saves 1.6 seconds as opposed to simply doing the cinnamon swirl solution.  
- Buffer your next input while sliding by holding the direction you want to go. Practice buffering inputs between each slide or it won't work consistently. 

#### Is It Really A Snow Poff?
- Enter the room holding down and right to avoid getting stuck on the first snow poff and walk over to Greater Dog.
- Use the `Stick` and then `Spare`. 
- Hold down during Greater Dog's attack in case it chooses to BARK. You can skip the BARK attack by running into the dog at the bottom. If you hold down it shouldn't have any chance to BARK before you hit it.

## Snowdin Town
- Purchase the `Manly Bandanna (50 GOLD)` in the Shop but DON'T equip it yet. 
- If you are doing Kindergarten strats for Undyne buy a `Bisicle (15 GOLD)` as well.
- Take the Underground Tunnel to the other side of town and continue right to Papyrus.

### Papyrus
- `Check` Papyrus for 3 turns and run into 5 bones to until you have `1 HP`. `Flirt` also works, but the date is slower.
- It is faster to let him capture you by losing the fight three times.
- Avoid the chew toy and exit the garage. Go back to Papyrus to start the second fight.
- You start the fight "blue" now. `Spare` Papyrus for 3 turns and run into 5 bones to until you have `1 HP` again.
- Repeat the last two steps for the third fight.
- Walk out of the garage for the final time and go back to Papyrus.
- Carefully choose `No` to fighting Papyrus again and mash through the rest of the dialogue.

#####Split when you regain control after Papyrus leaves the screen. 

Head back left and talk to Papyrus infront of his house. Follow Papyrus into his house, enter his room and talk to him to start the hangout.

###Hangout Start!
- Press `C / CTRL` to make the `Friendship HUD` appear.
- Mash through the rest of the hangout. The answers don't matter.
- After he changes outfits, select his "hat" (mouth). Platonically. 
- Answer `Yes` to the first two questions and `Refuse` to eating the spaghetti. It's faster but the menuing is difficult.
- Mash through the rest of the dialogue and hold DOWN to leave his room immediately. 
- Exit his house then continue right to Waterfall.

#####Split when you regain control after dating Papyrus. 

-----

-----

## Waterfall

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Aaron | `Flee` | *Who wouldn't?*
Woshua | `Flee` |
Moldsmal | `Spare` |
Shyren | `Flee` |
Temmie | `fLE E!!` |

Walk right through the next several rooms. No need to `SAVE` here. Enter the waterfall in the room after Sans to pick up the `Old Tutu`. Again, DO NOT equip it. Walk down and right into the tall grass. Mash through all of the dialogue and keep walking right. Don't `SAVE` here either. Quickly make the bridge using the seeds and cross it to the next room.

Move down slightly when you enter to avoid getting stuck on the small bridge. `Flee` from the Aaron and pick up the Bridge Seeds. Place them facing upwards from the lower peninsula so they line up infront of the waterfall. Drop the last one facing left and cross the bridge. Mash through Papyrus' call and continue up through the door.

Move right avoiding the Echo Flowers and `Flee` from the Woshua. Walk to the top and open the way to the next room. Take the raft and continue right to the next room.

### Undyne Spears 1
- Navigate the boardwalk and dodge the spears.
- You have no hitbox in your character's head, only the torso and slightly under the feet.
- You can get hit while in the grass although it is rare.

Move right and mash through the dialogue. Heal at the `SAVE` here if you want but you will have more chances later. Walk right and down into the large swamp room. Mash through Papyrus' phone call and `Spare` the pair of Moldsmals. Head up to the next room. Mash through Onionsan's dialogue and keep moving right. Move around the pond and `Flee` from Shyren and continue right through the next several rooms. Don't take an umbrella, it just wastes time.

Walk along the top of long room so Monster Kid has less distance to travel, then walk along the bottom after they start following you. Walk down and right through the next room. Wallhump at the castle room to move twice as fast.

In the next room talk to Monster Kid as soon as possible. It takes just over 4 seconds from the start of the dialogue before they will offer to lift you up. Stand near them and wait for the next dialogue. Mash through the remaining dialogue once it appears and continue right. `SAVE` to heal only if you absolutely need to.

###Undyne Spears 2: The Reckoning
- [Navigate the bridge](http://i.imgur.com/2tCriVW.png) and avoid getting hit.
- You can manipulate these spears by moving all the way up or all the way down in a sort of zig-zag pattern. 
- You can walk through spears when they begin to fade after fully extending. 
- Keep walking right on the last bridge until the third set of spears fade away then go back left.



Mash through the cutscene and walk right. Use the `SAVE` to heal if necessary and possibly save the game if you are unsure about the next fight. Walk right and up to face the Mad Dummy. Mash through the dialogue and begin.

### Mad Dummy
- Mash `SPARE`.
- Hit it with as much cotton as you can safely. It will take some practice to lead the cotton when the dummy begins moving around.
- It's possible to finish the first phase of the fight during the second red dummy attack (fifth turn), although this is difficult.
- Unlike the cotton, which is hit-based, the rockets will always take 4 turns. Start closer to the bottom during the final rocket attack so they don't trap you.
- It is NOT faster to get hit by the rockets or the knife. 
- Avoid to Napstablook's tears and mash to the end of the fight.

Walk up to the next room and mash through Napstablook's dialogue. Use the `SAVE` to heal and save if you need it. If you're brave, you can skip this `SAVE` for the 2-cycle strat. Just make sure your health works for the Mettaton Quiz skip later. 

Continue right and go up into the shop. Purchase the `Cloudy Glasses (30 GOLD)` from Gerson but DON't equip them. Back out and go right through the next two rooms.

Memorize the pathing for the Mushroom Room and the Lantern Room. It is possible to avoid the encounter (Temmie) in the Mushroom Room with optimal movement. Temmie will replace the encounter in the next room instead.

Walk right through the dark room and approach the Echo Flower from the top left to trigger it sooner, use the tall grass as a guide. Mash through the dialogue then walk left and up into the next room. Keep walking all the way up then go right. Move down slightly when you enter the next room to avoid getting stuck on the bridge. Walk across the bridge to trigger the cutscene and mash through the dialogue. When Monster Kid falls go right and exit the room. Mash through the dialogue, move down slightly again to avoid getting stuck on another small bridge, and continue right to Undyne's Arena. 

Before you trigger Undyne's cutscene...

##### [Practice This](http://webm.host/5d78a/)
- Walk right into Undyne's Arena and make a sharp turn upward so that your character's left hand is slightly over the light purple border (while facing upward) and move up to the trigger. Once Undyne's dialogue finishes hold down until you reach the room transition (below the black area) and immediately start walking up in the next room. 

### Undyne

There are currently alternate strats for saving time on Undyne. The first requires a healing item (`Bisicle (15 GOLD)` prefered, `Astronaut Food` can be a last minute backup) and the second is faster but requires precise positioning. Both take practice.

##### [Kindergarten](https://youtu.be/pRMu_rzQR1A) (Slower and more dangerous, but less precise.)
- For this you do not need to perform the warp glitch (above) but it's still a bit faster.
- Intentionally get hit by at least one spear in Undyne's first attack pattern four times. Always block the last spear in any of her attacks as Undyne's turn ends as soon as the last spear disappears. 
- `Challenge` will make the spears move faster for the first four turns, however, the extra time spent menuing is actually the same or even SLOWER than just mashing `Spare`. After Undyne unleashes her "kindergarten" attack the spears will remain at max speed for the rest of the fight, regardless of how many times you used `Challenge`. Continuing to select `Challenge` beyond this point is SLOWER.
- DO NOT `Flee` yet. Instead, `Spare` her for two more turns until she turns you green again. Keep selecting `Spare` until you turn red for the last time, *then* `Flee`. Remember to take enough damage during the fight for the Mettaton Quiz Skip. Arrow attacks do 5 damage, the last spear does 4 damage.
- If you didn't use the glitch warp: hold UP after the fight. Undyne will catch you again in the second room as well as the third room. `Flee` from both and hold RIGHT in the third room. 
- Mash through Papyrus' phone call and keep going until you cross the bridge to Hotland. Undyne can catch you again if you don't mash fast enough.

##### [2-Cycle](https://youtu.be/HmG9zoRrEGU) (Faster and less dangerous, but more precise.)
- Skips Undyne's 3rd phase (instead of her 2nd) and saves over 40 seconds from the other method. (Credit to Raikou99...?)
- Start off with the glitch warp (above) in the first room to get to the second room without fighting. 
- Walk up as far as you can until Undyne catches you in the second room. Swerving makes her take longer to catch you.
- Block her attacks normally. `Challenge` her for the first four turns, then `Spare` for the last two. Try not to take damage at least until the last turn as Undyne will slow her next attack if you get hit. 
- `Flee` when you turn red and walk up to the next room.
- Move right and stop at the 4th ["bump"](http://i.imgur.com/o6jgyHa.png) from the green marquee border. You should be directly under the middle of the 'W' when Undyne catches you. 
- `Challenge` for three turns and then `Spare`. Block her attacks until the last turn so doesn't reduce her attack speed. Remember to take enough damage between both fights for the Mettaton Quiz Skip. You want to end the second fight with `1-3 HP`. Arrow attacks do 5 damage, the last spear does 4 damage.
- `Flee` again when you turn red and hold RIGHT. If done correctly, Undyne won't chase you immediately. Mash through Papyrus' phone call and keep moving right across the bridge to Hotland.

Hold RIGHT and UP while crossing the bridge to come out on the top edge when Undyne stops you. You can use the water cooler from lower than expected and pour the water on Undyne from higher than expected. Be careful not to press `Z/Enter` on the water cooler after you have the cup or you'll dump out the water and have to do it again. Pour the water on Undyne, wait for her to leave, and walk right to the lab.

#####Split when you regain control after Undyne leaves the screen.

## Hotland

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Vulkin | `Flee` |
Tsunderplane | `F-Flee!` |
Pyrope | `Flee` |

DO NOT use the `SAVE`. You don't want to heal here, you'll have another chance to in a few rooms. Walk around it and enter the lab.

Walk right through the lab and up to the dog food bag so when Alphys comes out of the elevator she has less travel time. Mash through the dialogue until...

### Mettaton Quiz
- Move up and left to choose `[A] Money`. If you have `1-3 HP` the quiz will skip to the end.
- If you healed or have too much `HP` just continue to select the wrong answer until you are at `1 HP`. Each wrong answer halves your health. 
- Choosing `[A] Undyne` for the final answer is the fastest.

Mash through the rest of the dialogue, walk right and up to the bathroom sign. Again, being closer to the top means less travel time for Alphys. Exit the lab through the right and be ready to mash through several status updates. 

Hold UP on the left conveyor belt to go faster, `Flee` from the Vulkin, mash through the status update. On the second conveyor belt swerve while holding UP to move faster and enter the next room.

Use this `SAVE` to heal to full but don't save yet. Walk right and `Flee` from the Tsunderplane. Take the vents right, up, and left. Mash through the status updates and phone call then exit the room.

> Alternate Route: Take the vents right, up, right and then go down into the lower room. Jump to the left, pick up the `Burnt Pan`, equip it, and drop the `Tough Glove`. Use this to kill Asgore instead of the `Worn Dagger`. Exit this room and take the vents back to the laser room as normal.

Walk along the bottom row at the start of this room to avoid Alphys' phone call explaining laser movement. This saves around 2.50 seconds (credit to Wolfiexe). Keep walking right and dodge the lasers, don't bother pressing the button to turn them off and continue to the next room.

Mash through Alphys' dialogue and wait for the arrow to point right or left, whichever comes first. Jump to the first puzzle room, mash through either the call or the status update and then go back do the remaining puzzle.

### Slide Puzzle 1 (Right)
Up, Left, Fire

### Slide Puzzle 2 (Left)
Up, Left, Down, Left, Fire

Jump back to the center and wait for the arrow to point up, then jump up and continue through the large door. Mash through the status update and phone call and take the vents to the next room.

### Cooking with a Killer Robot
- Walk into the room near the top to pick up the food faster when the lights turn on. Don't get stuck on the fridge.
- You can pick up the food from lower than expected, sometimes without even facing up.
- Place the food on the bottom counter from as far up as possible. With [precise positioning](http://i.imgur.com/iw4ZAeq.png), you can place the food on the right edge of the cutting board and be standing far enough up that you don't talk to or get stuck on Mettaton when walking right. If you can't get the alignment consistently just place it more to the left so you don't accidentally talk to Mettaton again afterward.
- Walk right and enter the jetpack minigame on the top edge; the top edge saves about .2 seconds over the bottom edge. The best time for this minigame is to end with 15 seconds when you lose movement control.

Mash through the rest of the dialogue and continue right until reaching the elevator. Enter the elevator and carefully select `Right Floor 2` (bottom right). Exit the elevator and go left past Sans. Walk along the bottom of the long room to avoid the chain of status updates between Alphys and Papyrus (credit to TGH). `Flee` from the Pyrope and continue to the bottom room.

Mash through the friend request and pick up the `Stained Apron`. Again, DON'T equip it. Go back up and left into the next room.

### Conveyor Belt Puzzle
- Walk up to the top conveyor belt and mash through Alphys' first phone call.
- It's possible to trigger the third button before Alphys can call to interrupt you. Doing this glitches the dialogue, loudly, but opens the forcefield. It can save up to 1 second over dialogue mashing but doing this wrong can also crash the game; [BE WARNED](https://youtu.be/ocBtQ76tMJo).
- If you miss it or decide not to do it, just mash through the second phone call and enter the next room.

### Jumping Puzzle
- Walk up to the first vent and mash through the status update and phone call. 
- Go straight across using all of the left arrows. Press `C / CTRL` on the last button and continue to the next room.
- If you can't do this or fail too many times, the normal solution from the start is: left, down, down, left, up, down, up, up, left.

#####[Practice This](http://webm.host/b71a6/)
- Press `C / CTRL` the frame after you land on the red and white button. Watch the bottom of the steam jet that launches you for a visual cue when it begins to fade. Mashing `C / CTRL` works as well but if you mash in the wrong rhythm it could completely miss. 

Mash through Alphys' status updates and walk left past the `SAVE`. Keep walking until the royal guards stop you and pull you back. Mash through the dialogue and begin the fight.

### Royal Guard
- `Clean Armor` for Guard 02. Dodge the attacks touch the green part 5 times.
- `Whisper` to Guard 01. Dodge the second attack.
- Mash through the dialogue and `SPARE`.

Continue around and into the next dark room. Keep walking right and mash through the starting dialogue.

### MTT News
- Walk to The Script and choose to report it. It has the fastest dialogue.
- Start by defusing the bomb in the lower left. Arc around the right side to come back to the middle.
- Recommended order: Game > Script > Present > Basketbomb > Dog > Glass.
- You can spam `Z/Enter` on the Present and Basketbomb to attack them on the instant the fight starts, which will defuse them.
- The best known time is a 61 upon ending the final bomb.

Walk right and exit the room at the top. Walk left to the elevator and mash through Alphys's next phone call. Enter the elevator and choose `Left Floor 3` (bottom left). Exit the elevator and go right past Muffet's bake sale. Mash through Alphys' phone call and navigate the maze to the bottom room.

Walk down to the lower conveyor belt and move across it, dodge the first laser by holding left or pressing `C / CTRL`. Get hit by the second laser encounter and use the iframes to pass the third laser, it's faster. Move up, carefully say `...no...` to watching anime with Alphys and enter the door.

### Slide Puzzle 3 (Down)
Left, Up, Left, Left, Right, Fire

Go back across the top conveyor belt and take the maze to the top room, `Flee` from the Tsunderplane and Vulkin group, and enter the door.

### Slide Puzzle 4 (Up)
Left, Right, Fire

Go back and take the vents to the right this time, go up through the large door. Don't bother using this `SAVE` now, you'll be back here real soon. 

Head right avoiding the spider webs and mash through the spiders' dialogue. Walk diagonally into the right side of the rounded slope for it to push you right slightly faster. DON'T MOVE after Muffet says `I heard...`, moving around while trapped in the web makes Muffet take up to 3 seconds longer to say her next line. Mash through the dialogue until the fight begins.

### Muffet
- Eat the `Spider Donut`.
- Mash through the proceding dialogue and `SPARE`.

Finish talking to Muffet then go back left and use the `SAVE` to actually save the game for what will likely be the first time in a run. Cross back through Muffet's lair and enter the MTT Musical. As soon as you see/hear Mettaton's dialogue CLOSE THE GAME and reload it. Go back through Muffet's lair for the final time and talk to Mettaton again. Carefully select `Skip This` and mash through the remaining dialogue until until Mettaton drops you into the dungeon.

#### Musical Puzzle
- Hold RIGHT and mash through even more dialogue until you can move again.
- The best time to end this maze is 11 seconds. [Route for the maze](http://i.imgur.com/om88n78.png).
- Remember that you can buffer inputs while sliding.
- Mash through the pre-fight dialogue.

### Mettaton Stage Fight
- `Check/Spare` the first turn.
- Mash through the phone call then select `Yellow`.
- Just shoot him once and mash until he goes off screen. Holding right while firing almost guarantees you won't hit him again.

Mash through Alphys' post fight call. The answer doesn't matter. Walk up through the next few screens, ignore the `SAVE` and take the bridge to the Core. 

## Underground Core

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Madjick | `Talk+Spare` | The `Stick` also works.
Astigmatism | `Flee` | May fail if you don't menu quickly enough.

Mash through Alphys' dialogue on the bridge, take the left path in the next room, and mash some more. `Talk` to the Madjick and avoid the attack with reversed controls. You can use the `Stick` instead to get one of the other attacks. Not taking damage here can save a little time later. Mash through more post fight dialogue and go up to the next screen. 

Mash through the call and press the switch. The order is Blue, Blue, Orange; or you can press `C / CTRL` and skip them all. Walk right and mash through a few more calls. Walk slightly down before the long laser bridge to avoid getting stuck on it and continue across, mashing and dodging the lasers. Continue to the next room for yet more mashing. Skip the `SAVE` and go left, up, and left for the puzzle.

### Slide Puzzle 5
Take your pick of solutions:
- Up, Up, Left, Down, Left, Down, Left, Fire. (Seemingly least awkward to do)
- Up, Right, Up, Left, Left, Down, Left, Fire.
- Up, Left, Up, Left, Down, Down, Left, Fire.

From the puzzle: head back right, down, and right to the `SAVE`; use it now if you need to heal/save. You don't need to do the Warrior's Path so just go up and right twice from here. Cross the bridge, `Flee` from the Astigmatism, and enter the door to Mettaton's arena. You can `SAVE` again here if you are still learning the essay skip.

## Mettaton Kai Ni
- Mash through the dialogue.
- `Spare` the first turn. DO NOT SHOOT METTATON to skip some extra dialogue. The last line is `Killing you myself!`.
- `Spare` for three more turns and avoid taking any damage to make things easier later.
- `Check` the last turn (boxes with bomb in middle as last attack) to save time menuing.
- `Turn` and mash through the rest of the fight.
- Restarting here is NOT faster, the game files do not save until Death By Glamour begins.

### `OHHHHH YES!`

##### Speechless...? ([Essay Skip](http://www.twitch.tv/pahchi/v/23842021))
- You need 12k ratings to finish the battle. You start with 4k.
- Equip the `Faded Ribbon (+1500 > 5500)`.
- Equip the `Manly Bandanna (+1500 > 7000)`
- Equip the `Old Tutu (+1500 > 8500)`.
- Equip the `Cloudy Glasses (+1500 > 10000)`.
- Equip the `Stained Apron (+1500 > 11500)`. Do this last so you don't have to later.
- You will need to gain the remaining 500-ish points by shooting obstacles. The legs are worth only +5 rating but can be shot multiple times very quickly while everything else gives +20. The yellow bullet has an object limit of one so shooting closer to an obstacle will let you shoot again faster. 
- Taking damage gives a violence bonus of +50, +25, +20, +15, and +10 but chances are you won't survive more than three hits.
- If done right, you won't have to hit the essay at all.

##### Pop Quiz!
- If you unfortunately get to the essay, type the bare minimum you need to. 
- The turn ends about 2.50 seconds after you press Z/Enter or stop typing. 
- The shortest time it will allow is about 4 seconds and it can last up to 15 seconds if you keep typing. 
- The essay prompt only checks for specific keywords (strings) or conditions and will only take the one with the highest priority. Typing `legs` gives +350. Typing `toby` gives +300 and has the highest priority (will overwrite any other keyword).

Mash through the viewer call-in dialogue until the battle ends, then mash through Alphys' dialogue afterward. 

#####Split when you regain control after fighting Mettaton. 

Walk around Mettaton's torso to the next room. Start walking down the hall and mash until you can enter the elevator. Press the switch and enjoy the 20 second ride before story time.

-----

-----
## New Home
Exit the elevator and follow the long road to the King's home. You don't need to `SAVE` at any of the points along the way.

Be ready for several story encounters once inside the house. Mashing DOES NOT speed up the text BUT you will need to press `Z / Enter` at the end of each encounter. You will also need to advance through some dramatic pauses for: the 2x Loox encounter, the Knight Knight+Madjick encounter, and the Moldsmal+Loox+Migosp encounter.

Go left to the kitchen for the first key then right to the hallway for the second key. Enter the children's room and open the present on the left to pick up the `Worn Dagger`. Equip the `Stained Apron` if you mismenued in the Mettaton fashion show and drop a piece of armor or consume the bandage. Exit the bedroom and unlock the way to the basement stairs. Continue right on the long road until the story encounters stop and enter the Last Corridor.

> Alternate Route: Don't enter the children's bed room for the `Worn Dagger`. 

###Judgement

There are alternate methods for this room. The first is what most players should use, it is more convenient and faster in most cases. The second has potential now that load times of 2 seconds are possible, but it has more room for error.

#####If you do not have a load time of less than 3 seconds: (No Reset)
- Do not use the `SAVE` and continue right to Sans. 
- Wait for the bells and mash through the all of the dialogue. Only `Z / Enter` will work for the first part, then mash normally once Sans begins talking.
- Hold RIGHT and walk up through the next few rooms until Asgore.

#####If you have a load time of less than 3 seconds: (Reset)
- *This barely saves time and is heavily hardware/input reliant.*
- `SAVE` the game before Judgement.
- Once you see the first bit of dialogue start mashing and don't stop.
- Hold RIGHT and walk up through the next few rooms until Asgore.

Mash through all of Asgore's disjointed dialogue and `SAVE` in the Throne Room instead of The End (Credit to Essentia). This will save up to a combined 3.5 seconds between the three times you pass through the Throne Room. 

Enter the next room and follow Asgore right while mashing two more times. Ignore the `SAVE` and go up to the barrier. Select `Continue` and begin the fight.

### Asgore
- Mash through his speech as he shatters your `MERCY`.
- Eat the `Butterscotch Pie` on your first turn to lower his defense by 5 (inflicting around 10 more damage). Alternatively, you can spend the first three turns using `Talk` to lower his defense by 10 (inflicting around 20 more damage), allowing you to end the fight in the same amount of turns. If you really want to play it safe, `Talk` for three turns AND use the `Butterscotch Pie` to lower his defense by 15 (inflicting around 30 more damage), heal, and still end the fight in the same amount of turns.
- Asgore won't kill you if you have more than `1 HP` when you take damage. Use the `Stained Apron` to your advantage.
- Reminder that blue is stand still, orange is move.
- The game will start scaling your damage on the 21st turn. Ideally the fight should end by the 23rd turn with the `Worn Dagger`.
- `FIGHT` Asgore at the choice; it's faster. Let Flowey close the game and be ready to reopen it.

> Alternate Route:  With just the `Butterscotch Pie` and good accuracy, [the `Burnt Pan` can end this fight by the 16th turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14hHrL5ULgQ).

#####Split when you select `FIGHT`. 

-----

-----
## My World

Quickly reopen the game, select `Continue`, and walk up to use the `SAVE`. Mash through all of Flowey's dialogue and begin the fight.

### Omega Flowey
- All of Flowey's attacks do 25% of your current health. On the 14th hit your health is approximately .356 and gets rounded down to 0. Each healing item seems to give 5 extra hits, regardless of what the bar shows.
- It's not possible to die during soul phases, brave the damage to hit each `ACT` faster.
- Phase 1 (Toy Knife): Knives go the direction `ACT` will be. Head to the top left/right.
- Phase 2 (Tough Glove): Top left of the room for the `ACT` during the gloves.
- Phase 3 (Ballet Shoes): All the way to the right to get to the `ACT`. Don't miss it or you won't catch up to it.
- Phase 4 (Torn Notebook): Above the middle for `ACT`, RNG on whether it appears from the left or right.
- Phase 5 (Burnt Pan): Middle pan for the `ACT`. You can move above the pan for this. (12 waves)
- Phase 6 (Empty Gun): Immediately move to either of the bottom corners (you need to be directly in the corner, not just near it) and wait there. This should lock the rotation of the gun and make it fire much faster, saving up to 4.5 seconds (Credit to Mylexsi). Wait until around the 7th wave and start moving towards the gun to press the `ACT` as soon as possible. 
- Wait for the screen to flash white (YELLOW heart in the monitor changes to AQUA) and the "Saved" music to start, then immediately CLOSE THE GAME. Reopen the game, advance through Flowey's text, and wait for his laugh to end. This skips the two healing cutscenes and saves up to 12 seconds, depending on load time.
- Phase 7: Don't die. The `FIGHT` button will automatically reappear at a set interval every few seconds. If you wait too long to press it and then press `FIGHT` twice consecutively it won't register the second attack and you will lose the damage.
- Stand near the edge of Flowey's pellet circle and mash through his dialogue. Touch the pellets as soon as he begins the "attack" and mash through the rest.

Move to the left after the screen fades to black to position yourself over the `FIGHT` button and press it as soon as it becomes visible. Once Flowey says `I` immediately CLOSE THE GAME. Reopen it and walk around Flowey to the gateway. Enter the gateway and the instant you see `UNDERTALE` you can CLOSE THE GAME again to skip the credits. 

Reopen the game for the last time and you'll be back at the `SAVE` in the last hallway. Walk down through the Last Corridor and take the elevator on the right to skip to the beginning of New Home. Take the Core elevator down and walk past Mettaton's arena. Take the elevator on the right and walk down again through the hotel. Keep going down until you see the royal guards then go right to the Hotlands elevator. Enter it and select `Left Floor 1`. Walk down around the `SAVE` and take the boat.

-----

-----
## Dating Start...?

Carefully select `Waterfall` and mash through and dialogue along the trip. Be sure not to mash too much and talk to the ferryperson again. Walk up from the boat, left, and then up into the last room on the left. 

#####Make room in your inventory if you didn't before. 

Talk to Papyrus, say `Yes` to the hang out, and mash until you can walk inside.

### Undyne Date
- Mash some more, the answer doesn't matter.
- Quickly sit on the chair to progress the date. Mash until you can move again.
- Select the tea when prompted (furthest right). 
- Mash through everything else, the answers don't matter.
- Mash as hard as you can to end the stirring part faster.
- Hold right to feel the heat. 
- Mash until the fight begins.
- `FIGHT` and immediately strike her. It does 1 damage regardless and it's faster than `Fake Hit`.
- Mash until Undyne leaves and you have `Undyne's Letter` in your inventory.

#####Split when you regain control after dating Undyne. 

Go back to the ferryperson and carefully select `Hotland` on the dogboat. Yes, it will always be a dogboat the second time. Again, be careful not to talk to the ferryperson once you're off the boat.

Move up and right to Alphys's door then slide `Undyne's Letter` under the door and mash.

### Alphys Date
- Mash through the third and final date. None of the answers really matter.

#####Split when you regain control after dating Alphys. 

Walk right and up from the garbage dump back to the boat. Take the ferry back to `Hotland` once again.

Go up from the boat and finally enter the lab. Walk right to the "bathroom" and enter it. Press the button and wait.

## True Lab

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Memory Head (Sink) | `CELL+Refuse+Spare` |
Endogeny (Dog) | `Stick+Spare` |
Lemon Bread (Save) | `Unhug+Hum+Flex+Spare` |
Amalgamate (Fridge) | `Joke+Joke+Joke` |
Reaper Bird (Mirror) | `Pray+Mystify+Pick On+Spare` | 

Here we are.

Exit the elevator and go right. Walk up, ignore the `SAVE`, and take the left path. Use the rightmost sink from the right side three times to make the Memory Head appear.

####Memory Head
- Select  `CELL` first
- Next select `Refuse`.
- Then  `Spare` it.

Take the RED key from the sink and use it in the room above you. Go back down and right, ignore the `SAVE` again and open the RED door. Continue on through the bedroom, get the YELLOW key from the middle-right bed. Use the `SAVE` in the top of this room if you need to heal or want to save.

Walk up into the hallway and go right. Press the button to turn on the fans and walk right to engage Endogeny faster.

####Endogeny
- Use the `Stick`.
- `Spare` it.

Walk back left through the hall and go up through the first door. Take the GREEN key from the bathtub and go back down to the hallway. Go left, ignore the top room for now, and activate the "SAVE" to fight Lemon Bread.

####Lemon Bread
- This fight can be a little RNG but it's not hard to react to.
- `Unhug`, `Hum`, and `Flex` in any order.
- `Spare` it.

Keep going left. Check the last fridge from the left side and walk towards the door to trigger the Amalgamate.

####Amalgamate
- `Joke` for three turns.
- It will "Spare" itself on the third turn.

Leave the BLUE key for now and go into the room to activate the GREEN switch. Exit the room and pick up the BLUE key while walking back right. Go around the DT machine again and enter the top room to insert the YELLOW key. Go back down and right to the bedroom. Use the `SAVE` if you need to then continue to the right room. Keep walking right until Reaper Bird appears.

####Reaper Bird
- Select `Mystify`, `Pick On`, and `Pray` in any order.
- Move to the bottom right corner during the floating heads attack so they can't hit you.
- `Spare` it.

Enter the door at the end and insert the BLUE key. Walk out of the room and back to the main room with the locked door. Open the door to the elevator and go left to the generator room. Activate the generator and mash through the dialogue. Walk dwon and right to the elevator and mash through more dialogue as you ride the elevator back to New Home.

#####Split when the elevator doors close. 

-----

-----
##New Home Revisited

Walk right from the now vine-covered door and up to the elevator on the left. Go down through the Last Corridor one more time and back up to Asgore. Because you saved in the Throne Room previously Asgore will repeat his dialogue at The End, but it's very quick. Ignore the `SAVE`, your health will be refilled soon.

### The Barrier

Mash through everything. It's a lot of mashing. You cannot die during the cutscene.

### Asriel Dreemurr
- Wait about 20 seconds for the music to kick in (rainbow effects), then `Hope` to reduce damage. You can buffer the first `Hope` by entering the dialogue and waiting for the music/background transition. 
- `Hope` to reduce damage and heal `1 HP`. `Dream` doesn't reduce damage but it heals for more and adds `Last Dream` to your inventory; good for the last turn before `Hyper Goner`.
- During `Hyper Goner`: Stay out of the green circle in the center and avoid all of the diamonds. Getting hit at any point will reduce you to `1 HP`.

### Asriel Dreemurr Kai Ni
- If you didn't get hit during `Hyper Goner`: you will start this phase at the health you entered with (ideally `20 HP`).
- `Struggle` for 4 turns. Surviving all four turns will save a significant amount of time.
- If you got hit during `Hyper Goner`: immediately die at the start of the first attack to refill your health and skip part of the attack animation. Dying at the end of an attack wastes more time.
- If you died on the first attack: Set yourself up to die again at the beginning of the fourth attack to skip the attack animation and some of the dialogue.

###Asriel Dreemurr Phase #3
- Mash through the dialogue until you can select `SAVE`.
- `SAVE` them all in no particular order. Be careful not to select `FIGHT`.
- There's a pre-determined amount of actions for each `SAVE`. So you can use the shortest `ACT` multiple times.
- When using `SAVE` on multiple Lost Souls at once, be sure to use at least one `ACT` on each or an unskippable dialogue will scroll after.
- Use the `Pie` while saving Toriel and Asgore, then use a single `ACT` afterward to end the fight.
- `SAVE` Asriel and mash through to the end of the fight. After using `SAVE` once the subsequent actions don't matter; it's a set number of turns until the end. You cannot die and having lower HP does not make the final attack go any faster.

`Do not` forgive and `Do not` hug Asriel. It's faster.

Mash a little bit more then walk right and up to the gateway. Select `I'm Ready` and mash through the end. Select `I want to stay with you` (it's faster) and mash just a little more. Toriel's last line of dialogue is: `Everyone is waiting for us!`.

#####Time ends on closing the last text box from Toriel.
