###Grinding

Unless otherwise noted, it is faster to exit and reenter the room directly after each encounter. In areas where there are two rooms with encounters next to each other, instead alternate which one you get the encounter in to minimize the time spent in screen transitions.

It is always okay to spare or flee against common enemies, unless otherwise noted. It will not abort genocide, even if you are in the last encounter before "but nobody came."

##Ruins
####20 kills

Do not count Fake Froggit and Toriel

Monster | LOVE 1 | LOVE 2 | LOVE 3 | Notes
:---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :----
Dummy | `ACT->Talk` | `N/A` | `N/A` |
Fake Froggit | `1-hit, center` | `N/A` | `N/A` | AKA first Froggit
Froggit | `N/A` | `2-hit, center + yellow` | `2-hit, center + mash` | 
Whimsun | `N/A` | `1-hit, mash` | `1-hit, mash` |
Moldsmal | `N/A` | `N/A` | `2-hit, center + yellow` | \**Sexy wiggle*\*

####Grind route
- Kill Fake Froggit for LOVE 2
- Get an encounter at the end of the Leaf Pile SAVE room and the required fall room, then grind alternating between that room and the single rock room. Note that getting hit by Froggit's jump attack immediately ends Froggit's turn
- After 12 kills, get your 13th kill at the end of the single rock room, then grind in the three rock room. Froggits cannot use their jump attack when there is another monster in the battle, so in Froggit + Whimsun encounters, kill Whimsun first

####Bosses
- Napstablook
 - oh... i'm not supposed to be here... sorry...

####Miscellaneous speed tricks
- By the time Flowey finishes saying "are you ready," be in the top-left corner to get hit by the nearest friendliness pellet. Then to the bottom-left for the circle
- Do not get the Butterscotch Pie

##Snowdin
####16 kills

Do not count Doggo, Dogamy, Dogaressa, Greater Dog, and Papyrus

Monster | LOVE 6 | LOVE 7/8 | Notes
:---- | :---- | :---- | :----
Ice Cap | `1-hit, center` | `1-hit, center` |
Snowdrake | `2-hit, center + yellow` | `2-hit, yellow + yellow` |
Lesser Dog | `2-hit, ACT->Pet + mash` | `N/A` | Do not spare
Jerry | `Lots and lots and lots` | `of center attacks` | Spare, unless you need 1 more kill

####Grind route
- Get encounters at the end of the Box Road SAVE room, and on the small bridge before Dogamy and Dogaressa
- Do not walk on the ice in the ice room to get an earlier Lesser Dog encounter
- After the Papyrus cutscene on death bridge, go into Snowdin, then back out immediately to grind

####Boss tricks
- Doggo
 - Run straight into his so it ends faster. Or, if you don't want to get hit, stop just before the attack hits you for a negligible time loss
- Dogamy + Dogaressa
 - Kill Dogaressa first to 1-hit Dogamy
- Greater Dog
 - On the bark attack, getting hit by the dog ends the turn immediately

####Miscellaneous speed tricks
- Get the Tough Glove out of the box, and equip it
 - Besides having more ATK, the Tough Glove's attack animation is faster than the Stick's by ~0.3 seconds

##Waterfall
####18 kills

Count Shyren and Glad Dummy

Monster | LOVE 9
:---- | :----
Aaron | `2-hit, center + yellow`
Woshua | `2-hit, center + mash`
Moldsmal | `1-hit, yellow`
- Applies to Tough Glove only
 - With the Ballet Shoes, simply get as many center hits as you can

####Grind route
- Just before entering the room with the Ballet Shoes, wait for an encounter
- OPTIONAL: After getting the shoes, if you encounter a 2 Moldsmal, spare the second, or if you encounter Aaron + Woshua, flee from Aaron
 - This is a risky strat saving ~4-10 seconds (4 if 2 Moldsmal, 10 if Aaron + Woshua) which has a 53.8% chance of succeeding. It decreases the amount of steps you need for every encounter later on, but if you encounter a second Temmie, it forces you to take an extra encounter at the end of the lantern room
- Get a 2nd encounter in the first room after Gerson, without leaving and reentering
- Grind between the hallway and the mush-room until 3/4 kills left, then continue walking to Undying

####Boss tricks
- Undyne the Undying
 - Practice. Once you have her patterns down you probably won't die to her

####Miscellaneous speed tricks
- Dodge Undyne's thrown spears
 - On straight paths the spears can be dodged by staying to the bottom, then moving up once Undyne throws her spears
 - Otherwise, it just takes practice to figure out where you can keep going and where you have to stop momentarily
- Get and equip the Ballet Shoes
 - In the second room after the crystal SAVE, take the first left, then get an encounter before entering the shoes room
- Dodge Undyne's floor spears
 - Follow [this path](https://i.imgur.com/2tCriVW.png)
 - Same as the other spears, practice to figure it out
- OPTIONAL: Buy the Cloudy Glasses
 - This makes Undying a lot safer, but they don't save any time

##Hotland
####40 kills

Count the Royal Guards and Muffet

Monster | LOVE 13-15 | Notes
:---- | :---- | :---- | :----
Astigmatism | `1 gold / 2-hit (1-hit w/Hat)` | The reason to get the Cowboy Hat
Whimsalot | `1-hit` |
Final Froggit | `1-hit` |
Knight Knight | `1 perfect / 2-hit 1 gold` | The reason to keep the Bandage
Madjick | `1 perfect / 2-hit` |

####Grind route
- OPTIONAL: Early pan
 - The Burnt Pan is somewhat faster to obtain than the Empty Gun
 - Only use this strat if you are confident in your ability to get golds very consistently, as every missed gold on an Astigmatism wastes 9 seconds, completely negating the initial gains
- If not using the pan, get the Empty Gun and Cowboy Hat from Catty and Bratty's shop
- At 6/7 kills left, get the rest of your kills on the Path of the Warrior (the bridge with the rigged encounters)

####Early pan
[Video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipdEo5kY3kI)
- Walk up to the side of the dog food
- Hold left+right, hold up to bounce off the wall, then interact with the dog food after a moment
- Skip through Mettaton's dialogue until you automatically step forward
-- If desired, you can walk a few tiles forward while mashing through the dialogue. This saves about a second, but if you don't get to the fridge in time, you fail the glitch
- Interact with the fridge, and continue the dialogue up to the choice to get the noodles
- Hover over "Leave it"
- Mash through when Mettaton's dialogue overlaps the existing textbox
- Optionally, open the menu and attempt to equip the pan before the cutscene completely ends
-- You have to be quick with it, since when the camera locks back into place movement is enabled again, and the menu stops working

####Miscellaneous speed tricks
- Take the elevator to L3
- Take the Core elevator

-----

##Sans
- Equip the Ballet Shoes. They have the fastest attack animation by far, saving 8 seconds over the fight
- Don't die.
